I hold a Ph.D. in Science-Physics from Karl-Franzens University of Graz, along with a bachelor's degree in Physics and a Master's in Science-Astronomy from the National University of Colombia. I have focused on the area of scientific computing and the development of computational tools for the analysis of astronomical satellite images especially in visualization, data acquisition and data analysis of high-resolution images from space and ground solar telescopes. My Ph.D. research centered on the interaction between solar plasma and magnetic fields across different scales. Additionally, I am an active member of the SunPy collaboration, where I contribute to developing Python-based tools for solar physics research.
